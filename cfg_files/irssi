# irssi configuration example
# Modified 2009-07-31
# A more recent version of this file may be found at http://misc.nybergh/pub/irssi
#
# The base of this quite trivial irssi configuration example was given to me by a nameless knight in
# shining loonix armor some time ago. If you know irssi, this file will be a boring read. Go away.

# The reliability status of this configuration is "Works for me".
# Send whine and complaints to /dev/null, suggestions and fanmail to thomas at nybergh.net
# See alsÃ¸: http://www.nybergh.net

# This file is to be named ~/.irssi/config

# Using this configuration, your channels and queries will be
# logged in a sensible way under ~/irclogs/[chatnet]/[windowname].log

# THIS PART HANDLES SERVERS

#THIS PART HANDLES CHATNETS/IRC NETWORKS
# If you like irssi, and want to do avoid all other chat software,
# take a look at BitlBee (http://www.bitlbee.org). This offers a relatively easy to set up 
# an IRC -> Jabber/Windows Live/Yahoo/[name of proprietary chat system here]-gateway
# I used these guides to get my copy up and running:
# http://f0rked.com/public/bitlbee-user-guide.html
# http://thinkhole.org/wp/2006/09/20/howto-connect-to-google-talk-with-bitlbee/
# Please note that I only run BitlBee in a setup that allows me to connect from localhost, 
# I don't know if BitlBee is to be trusted as a service visible to the entire internets.
